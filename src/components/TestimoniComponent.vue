              When Iwas born, my parents lived in a teeny tiny Manhattan
              apartment. My ‘bedroom wasa closet lived in that closet until
              was wo and ahaif years old. 1 hhave the vaguest memories of my
              parents squeezing into my closet to read me bedtime stories. One

              Reminds me of “Harry Potter”—a book that was seminal in me
              falling in love ‘with writing. When did you first decide you
              wanted to work in publishing and, looking back. do you think
              there are any books that informed that choice?

              My younger sister and I loved The Baby-Suters Cab and Sweet
              Valley series. We ‘were intimately familiar with the entire
              cannon and collectively read all the books, allthe series,
              multiple times.

              Or complete immersion in these books meant we would occasionally
              spot what ‘we found to be very puzzling inconsistencies. When
              Hlearned that Ann M. Martin «and Francine Pascal did ot
              personally pen every single one of iy beloved books 1 et
              incredibly betrayed. How could some random person have been
              entrusted with ‘my treasured characters? This certainly
              explained why Mary Anne was confused about where her first date
              with Logan had been. No wonder Enid seemed to suffer trom
