                Three years ago, at midnight, I received a phone call with a
                212 area code. The voice on the other end was upbeat and
                friendly, with a strong New York accent. It was MacKenzie
                Fraser-Bub who, that night, became my literary agent, ‘She has
                read my most ‘personal stories, questioning every last
                sentence to make each one better. Although I have only met her
                in person twice, in some ways, this woman may know more about
                me than some of my closest friends.

                Today | turned the tables on MacKenzie. Born and bred in
                Manhattan, 1 asked her to tell me more about her life in the
                Big Apple: from growing up in a closet, to living in the
                centre of the publishing industry. She told me about the
                importance of place in the hoards of manuscripts she receives
                and the secret spot in the upper east side that she loves
                most.
